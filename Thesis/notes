#                         DURATION TABLE
# 
# This table contains values for T90 and T50, quantities related to burst 
# duration, for 1234 gamma-ray bursts that triggered the BATSE LAD detectors 
# between April 1991 and 29 August 1996.  T90 measures the duration of the time 
# interval during which 90% of the total observed counts have been detected.
# The start of the T90 interval is defined by the time at which 5% of the
# total counts have been detected, and the end of the T90 interval is defined
# by the time at which 95% of the total counts have been detected.  T50 is
# similarly defined using the times at which 25% and 75% of the counts have 
# been detected.  T90 and T50 are calculated using data summed over the 4 LAD 
# discriminator channels and using data summed over only those detectors that 
# satisfied the BATSE trigger criteria.
# 
# Users must note that T90 and T50 are not available for those bursts
# which suffer from data gaps during the event; the integration procedure
# inherently fails in these cases.  However, visual estimates of the burst 
# duration are provided in the BATSE Comments table for those bursts with 
# sufficient data coverage.  Users may also find other pertinent comments
# concerning the calculated value of T90 and T50 in the BATSE COMMENTS
# table, and it is highly recommended that the COMMENTS table be consulted
# before any distribution selected on T90 or T50 is used.
# 
# The table has seven columns, defined as follows:  
#   1) The BATSE trigger number.  This number can be used for cross-referencing 
#      with other tables in this BATSE catalog.  
#   2) T50.  
#   3) Uncertainty in T50.
#   4) The start time of the T50 interval, relative to the trigger time.  
#      The trigger time can be found in the BASIC Table.
#   5) T90.
#   6) Uncertainty in T90.
#   7) The start time of the T90 interval, relative to the trigger time.
# All columns are in units of seconds.
# 
# The measurements for trigger 148 were recalculated after errors in the
# 3B values were brought to our attention by Jay Norris.

# 
#                         BASIC TABLE
#
# This file specifies the locations and times for 1637 triggered gamma-ray 
# bursts observed from 19 April, 1991 until 29 August, 1996. It therefore 
# includes the data from the 3B catalog. The current version (4Br) has been
# revised from the version first circulated on CD-ROM in September 1997 (4B)
# to include improved locations for a subset of bursts that have been
# reprocessed using additional data.
# 
# Bursts since the end of the 1B catalog (March 1992) occurred when the
# GRO tape recorders were experiencing numerous errors.  Consequently,
# there are gaps in the data of many bursts that preclude valid measurement
# of peak flux, peak rate, fluence, or duration.  Peak rates on the 1 second
# timescale from each detector are almost always available.  These data 
# (called MAXBC rates) can be used to determine burst location.  Previous 
# difficulties with this data type have been largely removed, and we now
# believe that the systematic errors for MAXBC-located bursts are the same
# as for bursts located with other data types.  It is still true however, that
# the MAXBC-located bursts usually have larger statistical errors than would 
# be the case if another data type were available.  The comments table provides
# "L" comments for MAXBC-located bursts.  A number of CGRO and BATSE flight
# software changes have significantly reduced the problem of data gaps since
# March of 1993.
#    
# The on-board software determines when a trigger occurs.  When a burst 
# trigger occurs, subsequent triggers are disabled for an accumulation
# period, during which the BATSE burst memories accumulate data.  The
# accumulation period was 242 seconds until Dec 17, 1992, and from 
# Jan 8, 1996 to Feb 25, 1997.  At all other times it has been 573 seconds.  
# The stored burst data are then transmitted; the readout time for all 
# triggers was 90 minutes until Dec 17, 1992.  At that date, the flight 
# software was revised to suspend readouts during telemetry gaps and to 
# truncate readouts of weak events.  This resulted in a variable readout time. 
# During the burst data readout, the 64 ms threshold is revised to correspond 
# to the maximum rate attained by the current burst, and triggering is disabled 
# on the 256 ms and 1024 ms timescales.  Bursts intense enough to trigger over 
# this revised 64 ms value are termed "overwrites".  They appear as triggers in 
# this file, with the overwrite flag is set to 'Y'. 
# 
# The BATSE trigger numbers correlate all the files for this catalog.
# The trigger number is a running sequence of BATSE triggers which 
# include cosmic bursts, solar flares and other events.   The sequence
# begins with trigger 105 and ends with trigger 5586.   
# 
# Each burst has a unique catalog name.  These BATSE catalog names
# later may be incorporated into a multi-spacecraft catalog with 
# "GB" or "GRB" replacing this designation of "4B".  The characters   
# "4B " begin every BATSE catalog burst name, followed by the  "yymmdd"    
# of the burst.  "yymmdd" is the two digit year, two digit month, and 
# two digit day.  When more than one gamma-ray burst occurs on one 
# day, those bursts have a single letter suffix (B,C,D...), generally 
# in order of intensity.  Example:   4B 920503B 
# refers to the second brightest burst that triggered BATSE May 3, 1992.   
# The brightest burst on that day will have no suffix.  
# 
# The burst trigger time is the end of the interval (64, 256 or 1024 ms)
# on which the burst triggered the detector.   
# 
# For burst locations, the table lists statistical errors only. The systematic
# errors are described at 
# http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/batse/grb/catalog/4b/locerr/locerr.html
# and in a companion paper to the 4B catalog, which is currently available
# on the LANL preprint server as astro-ph/9901111.
# 
# There are twelve columns in this file:
#  
#  (1)  The BATSE trigger number. 
#  (2)  The BATSE Catalog burst name.
#  (3)  The truncated Julian Date (TJD) of the trigger 
#                  TJD = JD - 2440000.5
#  (4)  The time in decimal seconds of day (UT) of the trigger.
#  (5)  right ascension (J2000) in decimal degrees.
#  (6)  declination (J2000) in decimal degrees.
#  (7)  Galactic longitude in decimal degrees.
#  (8)  Galactic latitude in decimal degrees.
#  (9)  radius in decimal degrees of positional error box. 
#  (10) angle in decimal degrees of geocenter (the angle between the 
#       burst and the nadir, as measured from the satellite).
#  (11) overwrite flag: Y(true) if this burst overwrote an
#       earlier, weaker trigger.  N(false) otherwise.
#  (12) overwritten flag: Y(true) if this burst was overwritten
#       by a later, more intense trigger.  N(false) otherwise.
